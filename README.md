# Weather Forecasting on Pyspark using Big data techniques

A basic big data project which compares two time series models, AR and MA for weather forecasting.
We have demonstrated the use of mapreduce to clean the dataset. Since the dataset's file size is not so big, it can be stored on Hadoop or your local system. This was just a basic project to understand the concepts of mapreduce, time series etc. This was also our first project using pyspark.
The code can be run using a spark-submit command on linux.
